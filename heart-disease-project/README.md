# End-to-End Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. 
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+]. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering,
model selection, training and evaluation.

## Dataset
Dataset
The dataset contains information about various medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, 
and other 10 factors that could potentially influence the likelihood of heart disease. 

## Usage
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features, correlations, and potential patterns related to heart disease.
3. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the model's predictive performance.
4. Model Selection: Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for the task. Train and evaluate multiple models to identify the best-performing one.
5. Model Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed dataset.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
