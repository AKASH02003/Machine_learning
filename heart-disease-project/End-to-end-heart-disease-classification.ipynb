    "# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build\n",
    "a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical reports(attributes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps involved in building this classification model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problem definition \n",
    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Evaluation\n",
    "4. Features\n",
    "5. Modelling\n",
    "6. Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement:\n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about the patient, can we predict whether they have heart disease or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The Original data came from the cleavland data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether the patients has heart disease or not during the proof of concept,we'll pursue the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data. It can be done by doing research(such as looking at the above links) or by talking to a subject matter expert(someone who knows about the dataset).\n",
